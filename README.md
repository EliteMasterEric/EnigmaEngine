# Hello, friend!

This branch is a workspace where I do a bunch of stuff, mostly pull requests to [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine).

I have some code that adds Polymod support in the `feature/enhanced-mod-support` branch or older code that tries to implement 9-key over in `modcore-1.7`.
