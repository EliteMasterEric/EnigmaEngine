# characters

This data controls how characters are rendered during play. For data on how characters are rendered in the Story Menu, see `data/storymenu`.

Looking for the rest of the Vanilla characters? Those are only included in `vanilla` builds, and have been moved to the `assets/_vanilla/data/characters` folder.
