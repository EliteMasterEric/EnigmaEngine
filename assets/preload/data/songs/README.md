# songs

This folder contains the data for all songs, including charting and such. Vanilla charts are compatible here.

The folder name is the song ID, which is used to refer to the song elsewhere (such as the freeplay songlist and week song playlists). The `_meta.json` folder contains the proper name of the song if you want one (ideal if you want symbols in your song name, like `M.I.L.F`).
