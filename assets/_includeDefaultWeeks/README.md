# _includeDefaultWeeks

The contents of this file are applied to replace the base assets ONLY if the compile flag INCLUDE_DEFAULT_WEEKS is enabled.

This is used to easily create one build which includes the default weeks and another build which is a blank slate for mods, that only includes the tutorial and basic characters.
