# funkin.behavior.modchart

This behavior is DEPRECATED!

Lua modcharts are bad and hard to maintain and don't work cross-platform. I literally just left this code in from when I forked from Kade Engine.

Once I add stable and working Hscript modchart support, I'm cutting this completely, and possibly making a migration guide.
