# Where are the files?

I've moved a lot of the files in the workspace to subpackages to make the code structure more logical. Hopefully Git can keep up.

If you think it's hard to get to files quickly, just press `CTRL-SHIFT-P` in VSCode and type the name of the file you want to go to and it'll take you there faster than the Explorer.
