### Contributing
If you can write, I'd love it if you made a guide to put here. Simply make a [pull request](https://github.com/M/Kade-Engine/pulls) to add a file to this folder, and make sure it's written in Markdown.

Guides that need to be written:
- ModCore stuff.
- How to make custom dialogue (like Week 6)
- How to make custom characters
