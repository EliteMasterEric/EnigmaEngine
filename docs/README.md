PSYCH! Wait what even **is** Psych?

# About

Enigma Engine is a project developed as a love letter to the open source game development community, and to the many talented people who have been developing mods for Friday Night Funkin'.

Built on Kade Engine v1.7.0, Enigma is striving to provide features to help hardcore players improve, as well as let casual players have more fun with the game.

## Defining Features

### ModCore
DISCLAIMER: MODCORE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO AND APPROVED FOR A FUTURE VERSION OF KADE ENGINE. IT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED HERE.

Engima's flagstone feature is ModCore. Utilizing new improvements made to the Polymod library for Haxe, Enigma Engine boasts true mod support. No, not like the literal tens of thousands of people rebuilding the game with edited code to include new characters and songs, and no, not like Psych Engine which reads image files that you put in a folder.

I mean atomic, data driven, user configurable, flexible, scriptable, MODS. I mean being able to make full custom weeks without a single line of code, and add them to an existing install without having to redownload the WHOLE game executable and without risk of conflicts. I mean using the mod menu to easily reorder, enable, or disable mods with as much ease as managing texture packs in Minecraft.

#### No more 11GB Friday Night Funkin' folders. One release build, for all the mods.

You can learn more about ModCore and its capabilities [here.](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/EnigmaEngine/wiki/Modding-Guide)
Experience ModCore in action by playing the [Tricky Mod](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/ModCore-Tricky-Mod), made compatible with ModCore!

### Kade Engine
this is literally a Kade Engine fork what do you want me to say here
